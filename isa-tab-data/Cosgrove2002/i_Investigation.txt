Study Identifier	"Cosgrove2002"
Study Title	"The Catalytic Mechanism of Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehydrogenases: Assignment and 1 H NMR Spectroscopy pH Titration of the Catalytic Histidine Residue in the 109 kDa Leuconostoc mesenteroides Enzyme"
Study Description	"The chemical shifts of the C 1 and C ‰ 2 protons of His-240 from the 109 kDa Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) were assigned by comparing 1 H and 13 C spectra of the wild-type and mutant G6PDs containing the His-240 to asparagine mutation (H240N). Unambiguous assignment of the His-240 1 H 1 resonance was obtained from comparing 13 C- 1 H heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence NMR spectra of wild-type and H240N G6PDs that were selectively labeled with 13 C 1 histidine. The results from NOESY experiments with wild-type and H240N variants were consistent with these assignments and the three-dimensional structure of G6PD. pH titrations show that His-240 has ap K a of 6.4. This value is, within experimental error, identical to the value of 6.3 derived from the pH dependence of k cat [Viola, R. E. (1984) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 228 , 415 - 424], suggesting that the p K a of His-240 is unperturbed in the apoenzyme despite being part of a His-Asp catalytic dyad. The results obtained for this 109 kDa enzyme indicate that 1 H NMR spectroscopy in combination with heteronuclear methods can be a useful tool for functional analysis of large proteins"
