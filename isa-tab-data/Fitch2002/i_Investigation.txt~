STUDY
Study Identifier	"pKa values of buried residues: continuum methods and water penetration"
Study Title	"Experimental pKa Values of Buried Residues: Analysis with Continuum Methods and Role of Water Penetration"
Study Description	"Lys-66 and Glu-66 in SNASE titrate with pKa values of 5.7 and 8.8; these values can be reproduced with continuum electrostatics methods. High apparent polarizability can be rationalized in the case of Glu-66 in terms of internal water molecules--water molecules are absent in structures with Lys-66. Equilibrium thermodynamic experiments showed that Lys-66 mutant remained folded and native-like after ionization of the buried lysine. This high polarizability must reflect water penetration, local structural rearrangment, or both. Continuum methods finding pKa values allowed to relax in the field of bthe buried charged group, the pKa values of buried resiues were reproduced with the interior dielectric constant in the range of 4-5. The calculations show that internal waters can modulate pKa values of buried residues effectively."
