Study Title	"Principal component analysis of the pH-dependent conformational transitions of bovine"
Study Description	"To clarify the pH-dependent conformational transitions of proteins, we propose an approach in which structural changes monitored by heteronuclear sequential quantum correlation (HSQC) spectroscopy were analyzed by using a principal component analysis (PCA). We use bovine -lactoglobulin, a protein widely used in protein folding studies, as a target. First, we measured HSQC spectra at various pH values and subjected them to a PCA. The analysis revealed three apparent transitions with pKa values of 2.9, 4.9, and 6.8, consistent with previous reports using different methods. Next, Gdn-HCl-induced unfolding was examined by measuring tryptophan fluorescence at various pH values. Between pH 2 and 8, -lactoglobulin exhibited a number of structural transitions as well as changes in stability represented by the free energy change of unfolding, GU. By combining the NMR and fluorescence results, the change in GU was suggested to result from the decreased pKa of some acidic residues. Notably, the native state at neutral pH is destabilized by deprotonation of Glu-89, leading to an increase in the relative population of the intermediate. Thus, the PCA of pH-dependent HSQC spectra provides a more comprehensive understanding of the stability and function of proteins."
