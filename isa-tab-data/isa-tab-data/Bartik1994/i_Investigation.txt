Study Identifier	"(bartik)turkey_hen_lysozymes"
Study Title	"Measurement of the Individual pKa Values of Acidic Residues of Hen and Turkey Lysozymes by Two-Dimensional 1H NMR"
Study Description	"The pH dependence of the two-dimensional 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of hen and turkey egg-white lysozymes has been recorded over the pH range 1-7. By monitoring the chemical shifts of the resonances of the various protons of ionizable residues, individual pKa values for the acidic residues have been determined for both proteins. The pKa values are displaced, with the exception of those of the residues in the active site cleft, by an average of 1 unit to low pH compared to model compounds.

Upper limits are given for the pKa values of Asp48 and Asp66 because an insufficient number of chemical shift values were obtained at low pH. The pKa values given in parentheses are the values obtained from the fitting program; the large standard deviations arise because of the lack of low pH data."
