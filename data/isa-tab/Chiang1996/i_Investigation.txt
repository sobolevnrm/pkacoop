Study Title	"The Role of Acidic Amino Acid Residues in the Structural Stability of Snake Cardiotoxins"
Study Description	"We have recently shown that membrane-related activities of cardiotoxin V from Naja naja atra (CTX A5) are diminished at acidic pH although the overall â-sheet structure of the molecule is maintained. In order to understand more about the mechanism of inactivation of CTX at acidic pH, we studied the effect of pH and denaturing reagents on the structural stability of CTX. We found, first, pH-induced structural transitions occurred in CTX A5 at two pH values as judged by the CD ellipticity around 195 nm: an increase in the â-sheet content occurred around pH 4 and followed by a decrease, therein, around pH 2. The pKa of three acidic amino acid residues in CTX A5, i.e., Glu-17, Asp-42, and Asp-59, were determined to be 4.0, 3.2, and below 2.3, respectively, by NMR spectroscopy. The low pKa value of Asp-59 implies salt bridge formation between Lys-2 and Asp-59. Thus, electrostatic interaction may stabilize the three loop structure in addition to the hydrogen bonds between N- and C-termini of CTX molecule. Second, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and guanidinium chloride (GdmHCl) were found to induce R-helical and random coil formation, respectively, in CTX A5 and eight other â-sheet CTXs. Comparison of the relative potencies of TFE and GdmHCl to induce structural changes suggests that the amino acid residue located at position 17 plays a role in the structural stability. Specifically, CTXs containing negatively charged Glu-17 are least stable. It is suggested that Glu-17 may perturb the interaction between Lys-2 and Asp-59, and thus the overall stability of â-sheet, in the presence of denaturing reagent. In conclusion, the perturbed structural stability of CTXs may partially explain the lower activity CTX exhibits at acidic pH. A structural model to account for the unfolding and refolding of CTX molecules without the breaking of disulfide bonds is also proposed."
