Study Title	"Proton-Translocating Carboxyl of Subunit c of FIFO H+-ATP Synthase: The Unique Environment Suggested by the PKa Determined by 'H NMR'"
Study Description	"Subunit c of the Hf-transporting FIFO ATP synthase (EC 3.6.1.34) is thought to fold across the membrane as a hairpin of two a helices with a conserved Asp/Glu residue, centered in the second membrane-spanning helix, which is thought to function in H+ translocation. NMR studies indicate that the purified subunit c from Escherichia coli is also folded as a hairpin in a chloroform/methanol/H20 (4:4:1) solvent mixture [Girvin, M. E., & Fillingame, R. H. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 12167-121771 and that the conserved Asp remains uniquely reactive in this solvent mixture [Girvin, M. E., & Fillingame, R. H. (1994) Biochemistly 33, 665-6741. The pKa of Asp61 is of interest because of its unique reactivity and because it is thought to protonate and deprotonate during each proton translocation cycle. We have determined the pK, value of the carboxyl group of the functional Asp in wild type and two functional, mutant subunit c proteins, i.e. the Ala24 - Asp (D24D61) and the Ala24 - Asp/Asp61 - Asn (D24N61) mutant proteins. The pKa values were determined by 'H NMR spectroscopy by measuring changes in the a and p proton chemical shifts by constant time two-dimensional (2D) correlated spectroscopy. The PKa of Asp61 in the purified wild type protein was 7.1. This pKa was significantly higher than the PKa of the other two Asp residues, i.e. Asp7 and Asp44 which were 5.4 and 5.6, respectively. The pKa of the two Glu residues in the protein were determined by 2D total correlation spectroscopy and found to be approximately 5.5. In the D24D61 mutant protein, the pKa values of both Asp24 and Asp61 were abnormally high, i.e. 7.1 and 6.9, respectively. In the D24N61 mutant protein, where Asp24 functions in proton translocation, the pKa of the functional Asp24 was 6.9. These observations suggest that the protein folds such that the local environment around Asp61 (or Asp24) is more hydrophobic than in the general environment of the organic solvent. The changes in chemical shift of sequentially assigned protons of other residues were followed as a function of pH as a general measure of structural changes in the protein. The analysis indicates a global conformational change in the protein coincident with the deprotonation of Asp61. The most pronounced effect of deprotonation is seen in the polar loop region and in the N-terminus. The conformational changes in this region of the protein, which are coupled to protonatioddeprotonation of Asp61, may mimic those taking place during ATPase-coupled proton translocation by the FIF, complex."
