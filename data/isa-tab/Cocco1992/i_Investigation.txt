Study Title	"Structural Comparison of Apomyoglobin and Metaquomyoglobin: pH Titration of Histidines by NMR Spectroscopy"
Study Description	"Proton NMR spectroscopy was applied to myoglobin in the ferric, water-liganded form (metMbH20) and the apo form (apoMb) to probe the structure and stability of the latter. Proteins from sperm whale and horse skeletal muscles were studied to simplify the spectral assignment task. Nuclear Overhauser effects and the response of chemical shifts to variations of pH were used as indicators of residual native holoprotein structure in the apoprotein. The investigation was focused on the histidine side chains and their environment. In metMbH20, the resonances of all imidazole rings not interacting with the heme were assigned by applying standard two-dimensional methods. These assignments were found to differ from those reported elsewhere [Carver, J. A., & Bradbury, J. H. (1984) Biochemistry 23,4890-49051 except for His-12, -1 13, and -1 16. Only one histidine (His-36) has a pKa higher than 7, two (His-48 and His-1 13) have a pK, lower than 5.5, and two (His-24 and His-82) appear not to titrate between pH 5.5 and pH 10. In the apoproteins, the signals of His-1 13 and His-1 16, as well as those of His-24, -36, -48, and -1 19 previously assigned in the horse globin [Cocco, M. J., & Lecomte, J. T. J. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 11067-110721, could be followed between pH 5 and pH 10. A comparison to the holoprotein data indicated that heme removal has limited effect on the pKa and the surroundings of these residues. Five additional histidines which occur in the two helices and connecting loops forming the heme binding site were identified in the horse apoprotein. Four of these were found to have pKa values lower than that expected of an exposed residue. The NOE and titration data were proposed to reflect the fact that several holoprotein structural elements, in particular outside the heme binding site, are maintained in the apoprotein. In the heme binding region of the apoprotein structure, the low pK,'s suggest local environments which are resistant to protonation."
