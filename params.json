{"name":"pKa Cooperative","tagline":"The pKa Cooperative for Protein Electrostatics","body":"## pK<sub>a</sub> Cooperative\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThe pK<sub>a</sub> Cooperative was organized to advance development of accurate and useful computational methods for structure-based calculation of pK<sub>a</sub> values and electrostatic energy in proteins.\r\nThe Cooperative brings together laboratories with expertise and interest in theoretical, computational and experimental studies of protein electrostatics.\r\nTo improve structure-based energy calculations it is necessary to better understand the physical character and molecular determinants of electrostatic effects.\r\nThe Cooperative thus intends to foment experimental research into fundamental aspects of proteins that depend on electrostatic interactions.\r\nIt will maintain a depository for experimental data useful for critical assessment of methods for structure-based electrostatics calculations.\r\nTo help guide the development of computational methods the Cooperative will organize blind prediction exercises.\r\nAs a first step, computational laboratories were invited to reproduce an unpublished set of experimental pK<sub>a</sub> values of acidic and basic residues introduced in the interior of [staphylococcal nuclease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrococcal_nuclease) by site-directed mutagenesis.\r\nThe pK<sub>a</sub> values of these groups are unique and challenging to simulate owing to the large magnitude of their shifts relative to normal pK<sub>a</sub> values in water.\r\nMany computational methods were tested in this 1st Blind Prediction Challenge and critical assessment exercise.\r\nA workshop was organized in the [Telluride Science Research Center](http://www.telluridescience.org/) to assess objectively the performance of many computational methods tested on this one extensive dataset.\r\nA [special volume](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.v79.12/issuetoc) of [PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%291097-0134) introduces the pK<sub>a</sub> Cooperative, presents reports submitted by participants in the blind prediction challenge, and highlights some of the problems in structure-based calculations identified during this exercise.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* [Data](data) - Data used by the Cooperative\r\n* [Presentations](presentations) - Presentations about predictions and other Cooperative-related research\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe following is an incomplete list of pKa cooperative participants:\r\n\r\n* [Emil Alexov](http://compbio.clemson.edu/), Clemson University\r\n* [Nathan Baker](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanandrewbaker), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\r\n* [Antonio Baptista](http://www.itqb.unl.pt/~baptista/), Universidade Nova de Lisboa\r\n* [Bernie Brooks](http://www.lobos.nih.gov/cbs/), National Heart Lung and Blood Institute\r\n* [Charlie Brooks](http://brooks.chem.lsa.umich.edu/), University of Michigan\r\n* [Qiang Cui](http://www.chem.wisc.edu/~cui/), University of Wisconsin\r\n* [Paul Czodrowski](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Czodrowski/), Merck\r\n* [Bertrand Garcia-Moreno E](http://biophysics.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/garcia-moreno.html), Johns Hopkins University\r\n* [Marilyn Gunner](http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~gunner/), City College of New York\r\n* Dan Isom, University of North Carolina\r\n* [Jan Jensen](http://synbio.ku.dk/research/researcher_profiles/jan_h_jensen/), University of Copenhagen\r\n* [Ernest Mehler](http://weill.cornell.edu/research/elmehler/), Weill Cornell Medical College\r\n* [Anthony Nicholls](http://www.eyesopen.com/staff), Open Eye Scientific Software\r\n* [Jens Nielsen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jens_Nielsen3/), Novozymes\r\n* [Jana Shen](http://faculty.rx.umaryland.edu/jshen/), University of Maryland\r\n* [Arieh Warshel](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2013/warshel-facts.html), University of Southern California\r\n* [Jim Warwicker](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/j.warwicker/), University of Manchester\r\n* [Wei Yang](http://www.chem.fsu.edu/bio.php?id=56), Florida State University\r\n* [Mike Word](http://www.eyesopen.com/staff), Open Eye Scientific Software\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
